whitecat_crossplateform short Features description
===================================================
WhiteCat Lighting Board is a free lighting desk for windows developped by Christoph Guillermet.

It can do a lot of stuff of course as lighting desk,artnet and dmx interfaces, cue, chanel macro, patch, xy mover and trichromie(not totally usefull actuely for motor lighting), etc...

But he has a lot of strange or useful other fonctions who make it able to be used for something else than linghting.

It can play sound, controle Arduino and Arduino HF prototype for electronique developpement, has a little video tracking module, an echo (sort of gravity and physical fonction of control), a draw module (to draw directly the light), a plot module to draw your light plot directly in whitecat and in sync with the soft, and a remote for iphone and ipad thrue iFantastick soft.

To start coding quickly:
==============
In windows :
-Follow the PREBUILD_INSTALL_WITH_CODEBLOCKS_AND_MINGW4.8.1.txt or the PREBUILD_INSTALL_With_DEV_C++_AND_MINGW4.8.1.txt

- if you want build yourself the libraries for an other plateform or compilator than MinGW4.8.1, you can get inspiration from the BUILD_LIBRARIES_INSTRUCTIONS_for_MinGW.txt

The API documentation
=====================
You can find a short doc genereted by doxygen in the API.
If you code an contribute to the whitecat project, please continue to comment your code with the doxigen format, for the others. 
If you are french a tutorial for doxygen and whitecat can be found at http://www.le-chat-noir-numerique.fr/whitecat/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=documentation_doxygen

If you are french, for how to use git a tuto is at http://www.le-chat-noir-numerique.fr/whitecat/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=recettes_pour_git

This two folder must cloned or copy inside the whitecat_crossplateform folders but you may find some lighter Prebuilds for this two repository for your environement and DEVKIT at : http://www.le-chat-noir-numerique.fr/coding/
